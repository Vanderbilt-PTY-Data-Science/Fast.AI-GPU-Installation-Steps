    "The first thing to do is to make sure your conda is cleared of current PyTorch packages, as Fast.AI probably installed PyTorch without CUDA. To do this, first install `anaconda-clean` with `conda install anaconda-clean`. Then run `anaconda-clean` and prompt `y` to clean your data. Next if you are on Windows, head over to Control Panel, and uninstall Anaconda there. Otherwise, you should find the Anaconda Uninstaller and use that."
